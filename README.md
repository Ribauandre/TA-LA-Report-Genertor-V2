# TA-LA-Report-Genertor-V3.1
Patches to the original Ta/La generator done by a previous team for the College of IST.

The TA/LA Report generator allows a user to form individual reports for each TA/LA in the
department of IST. The generator takes in raw data in the form of a .csv file and then uses that data and
compiles an overview report to analyze the TA or LA’s performance.
